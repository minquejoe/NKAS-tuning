### Acknowledgements

To all developers of **Alas** — I still find the source code absolutely amazing.  
It made me realize, “Wow, Python can actually be written like this!”  
Then I looked back at my own first version and thought, “Damn, that was some real crap.” 😅😅😅  
Well… even though NKAS is still crap now, at least it works. 😅😅😅

Special thanks to:  
- [AzurLaneAutoScript](https://github.com/LmeSzinc/AzurLaneAutoScript) for the script framework  
- [March7thAssistant](https://github.com/moesnow/March7thAssistant) for the PC-side support code
